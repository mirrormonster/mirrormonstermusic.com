Our new EP is featured on the Ann Arbor District Library's Pulp on their Friday Five segment!

From AADL's Christopher Porter:


> The debut EP by Ann Arbor's Mirror Monster offers upbeat electronica, with the lead track featuring local vocalist Ki5 navigating the space between a synth-pop brooder and a dance-floor anthem.
