Intrepid local music and art journalist and all around great guy [Christopher Porter](https://pulp.aadl.org/taxonomy/term/105490) has once again featured Mirror Monster in his regular segment for the Ann Arbor District Library's Pulp: [Friday Five](https://pulp.aadl.org/taxonomy/term/193552).

This time, our new single [Contact](https://open.spotify.com/album/3V4m2CX3TbWjhXM5QGPnOh) is being highlighted.

From Christopher:

> The latest single from Ann Arbor's Mirror Monster is a beautiful throwback to '80s
> synth-pop ballads in the spirit of Depeche Mode. 
> We need an all-locals synth-pop concert with Mirror Monster, Same Eyes, FFANGS, and Kawsaki.


Great idea Chris! We are so down for that.
