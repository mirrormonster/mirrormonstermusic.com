CROOKED - A font created with a rough brush and a lot of free time. With my second font, I wanted to trie something different, and defiantly wanted a font with at least two different styles. Styled based on a crooked y-axis the whole font is tilted upwards to the left. The font is free to use in your personal and commercial projects. Just Link me on your Projects, I'm stoked to see what other creatives do with my work. Cheers LHJ
