Mirror Monster is David Minnix and Michael Skib. They are an Ann Arbor, MI based band creating songs that navigate the spaces between electronic dance music, experimental, pop, and folk. 
Previously, Michael has played with local indie rock outfit The Paths; David has made electronic music for years as the solo act [xinniw](http://www.xinniw.net), and is a core organizer of [North Coast Modular Collective](http://www.northcoastmodularcollective.com/).
Their first show was in May 2019, at the Babe Island Music Festival in Ann Arbor. The duo has played a number of shows since then, including at Encore Records, The Blind Pig in Ann Arbor, and the Corktown Tavern in Detroit. Their first EP, [Free From All The Walls](https://mirrormonster.bandcamp.com/album/free-from-all-the-walls-ep), was released in September of 2020, and their second, [Pretty Things Made With All Our Love](https://mirrormonster.bandcamp.com/album/pretty-things-made-with-all-our-love), will be released on August 12th, 2021. They love to collaborate with local musicians, cowriting [Free From All The Walls Pt.1](https://mirrormonster.bandcamp.com/track/free-from-all-the-walls-pt-1-ft-ki5) with [Ki5 Loops](https://www.ki5loops.com/) in 2020 and completing remixes for Portland band [mindparade](http://www.mindparade.us/) and Ann Arbor based singer/songwriter/bandleader [Dani Darling](https://www.danidaydarling.com/) in 2021.
